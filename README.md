# Byte
Just another discord bot made in node.js. It's pretty cool though.

## Setup
Once you have downloaded the source code for Byte, you must run 
```
npm install
```
to install all of the latest dependencies required for Byte to run. After that, create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the source code. The file needs look like this:
```
TOKEN=[YOUR_BOT_TOKEN]
SERVER=[NAME_OF_SERVER]
PREFIX=[BOT_PREFIX]
NAME=[BOT_NAME]
PFP=[PROFILE_PICTURE_URL]
COLOR=[BOT_ACCENT_COLOUR]
URL=[BOT_URL]
NASAKEY=[NASA_API_KEY]
REPO=[GITHUB_REPO]
```
these can also be defined in the system's session variables. This customisation technology is used for creating two bots, **Byte** & **Byte2** running from the same source code, but with different avatars and colours.
